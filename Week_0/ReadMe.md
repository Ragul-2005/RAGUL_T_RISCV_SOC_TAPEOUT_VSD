# 📘 Week0 — RISC-V SoC Tapeout (VSD)

## 📌 Overview  
This folder contains my completed work for **Week0** of the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program.  
It covers two major tasks:  

1. [Task 1 - Documentation of Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning](./Task%201%20-%20Documentation%20of%20Digital%20VLSI%20SoC%20Design%20and%20Planning.md)
2. [Task 2 - Tools Installation and Setup Guide](./Task%202%20-%20Tools%20Installation%20and%20Setup%20Guide.md)

## ✅ Completed Tasks  

### 📝 Task 1: Digital VLSI SoC Design & Planning Summary  
- Summarized the complete SoC design flow — from **initial chip modeling** to **final integration**.  
- Topics covered include:  
  - Chip Specifications (C model & C testbench)  
  - RTL Architecture (Processor + Peripherals)  
  - RTL-to-GDSII Flow (Synthesis → Netlist → Floorplanning → Placement → Routing)  
  - Physical Verification (DRC & LVS)  
  - SoC Applications in real-world scenarios  
- 📄 Document: [Task1-Digital VLSI SoC Design & Planning Documentation](./Week_0/Task 1 - Documentation of Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning.md)

### 🛠️ Task 2: Tool Setup & Environment Installation  
- Successfully installed and verified all required tools for SoC design flow.  
- Environment tested for RTL design, synthesis, simulation, and physical design.  
- **Tools configured:**  
  - 🧠 **Yosys** – RTL synthesis  
  - 📟 **Icarus Verilog (Iverilog)** – Verilog simulation  
  - 📊 **GTKWave** – Waveform visualization  
  - ⚡ **NGSpice** – Circuit-level simulation  
  - 🎨 **Magic VLSI** – Layout design & analysis  
  - 🏗️ **OpenLANE** – Complete RTL-to-GDSII flow for ASIC design  
  - 🛠️ Verified system essentials: Git, Docker, Python3, pip, Make  
- 📄 Document: [Task2-Tool Setup & Environment Installation Guide](./Week_0/Task 2 - Tools Installation and Setup Guide.md)
